/**
 * this function computes an approximation of the probability
 * of a query sequence of KA A bases, KC C bases, KG G bases and
 * KT T bases appearing exactly n times in a reference sequence 
 * of length L. This is based on a simplified model using a Poisson
 * distribution (see e.g. Zhou, Xie: Exact Distribution of the Occurence
 * Number for K-tuples Over an Alphabet of Non-Equal Probability Letters)
 * The distribution is based on the single base relative frequences
 * of pA, pC, pG and pT of the respective bases in the reference sequence
