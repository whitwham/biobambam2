.SH NAME
lasToBAM - convert daligner las to sam/bam/cram
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B lasToBAM
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
lasToBAM reads one or two dazzler DB files and a daligner las file and
produces a sam, bam or cram file of the contained alignments. A FastA file
corresponding to the first of the two dazzler databases must be given via
the reference key. In addition a FastA index (.fai file) needs to be present
for this FastA file. Such an index can be generated by the normalisefasta
program of biobambam2 or using samtools faidx. The FastA file needs to have
the sequences of the first dazzler database in the same order, but can have
different names, which may be convenient as the dazzler database expects a
certain naming scheme while the desired reference may have other names.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9|11>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.P
If libmaus has been compiled with support for igzip (see
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/igzip-a-high-performance-deflate-compressor-with-optimizations-for-genomic-data)
then an additional valid value is
.IP 11:
igzip compression
.PP
.B verbose=<1>:
Valid values are
.IP 1:
print progress report on standard error
.IP 0:
do not print progress report
.PP
.B supstrat=<[none]>:
query string storage strategy for supplementary reads (soft, hard or none, default: none)
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. This option can only be given if
outputformat=bam. Then valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If md5filename is unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B outputformat=<bam>: output file format.
All versions of bamsort come with support for the BAM output format. If
the program in addition is linked to the io_lib package, then the following
options are valid:
.IP bam:
BAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP sam:
SAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP cram:
CRAM (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit). This format is not advisable for data sorted by query name.
.PP
.B O=<[stdout]>: 
output filename, standard output if unset.
.PP
.B outputthreads=<[1]>:
output helper threads, only valid for outputformat=bam.
.PP
.B reference=<[]>:
reference FastA file
.PP
.B calmdnm=<0|1>:
calculate the MD, NM and AS fields
.PP
.B threads=<>:
number of threads used for conversion. By default this is chosen as the
number of CPU cores detected on the machine.
