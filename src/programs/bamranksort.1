.TH BAMRANKSORT 1 "May 2015" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
bamranksort - sort BAM files by rank
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B bamranksort
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbamranksort\fR reads a BAM file (preferably in nearly sorted order),
sorts it in rank order and then outputs a BAM.
.PP
The input BAM file must already have the rank prefix added to the
alignment names and any attempt to sort a file without these name
prefixes will fail.
\fBbamranksort\fR also assumes that all alignments of the same name are
grouped together (a pair of reads plus any number of
supplementary/secondary reads).  If it finds any alignments in a
separate group the program will exit. 
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9|11>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level.
.IP 0:
uncompressed.
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression.
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression.
.P
If libmaus has been compiled with support for igzip (see
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/igzip-a-high-performance-deflate-compressor-with-optimizations-for-genomic-data)
then an additional valid value is
.IP 11:
igzip compression.
.PP
.B verbose=<0|1|2>:
Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not print progress report (default).
.IP 1:
print progress report to standard error.
.IP 2:
print more values for debugging only to standard error.
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. This option can only be given if
outputformat=bam. Then valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If md5filename is unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B misordered=<500000>:
number of alignments to accumulate before giving up.
.PP
.B step=<2>:
expected increment between ranks.
.PP
.B outputthreads=<[1]>:
output helper threads.
.PP
.B inputformat=<bam>: input file format.
All versions of bamsort come with support for the BAM input format. If
the program in addition is linked to the io_lib package, then the following
options are valid:
.IP bam:
BAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP sam:
SAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP cram:
CRAM (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit)
.PP
.B outputformat=<bam>: output file format.
All versions of bamsort come with support for the BAM output format. If
the program in addition is linked to the io_lib package, then the following
options are valid:
.IP bam:
BAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP sam:
SAM (see http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf)
.IP cram:
CRAM (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/cram_toolkit). This format is not advisable for data sorted by query name.
